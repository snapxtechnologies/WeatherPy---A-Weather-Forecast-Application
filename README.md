## Description

**WeatherPy** is a simple yet powerful weather forecast application built with Python. This project is designed to help new interns and beginner developers get started with Python development and version control using Git and GitHub. By working on this project, interns will learn essential programming concepts, how to interact with external APIs, and best practices for collaborative software development.

**Key Features:**
- Fetch current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Display weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and a brief description of the weather.
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface for ease of use.

**Project Goals:**
- **Learning:** Provide a hands-on learning experience for new developers.
- **Collaboration:** Foster collaboration and teamwork among interns.
- **Best Practices:** Introduce interns to best practices in coding, documentation, testing, and version control.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **Requests:** A simple HTTP library for making API calls.
- **Unittest:** Pythonâ€™s built-in library for writing and running tests.
